## About

Contains examples for the [nakadi-java-client](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/nakadi-java) 
project.


## Requirements and Getting Started

The code examples are mostly main classes showing how to use the client against a Nakadi server. 

The project is built with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) and uses the 
[Netflix Nebula](https://nebula-plugins.github.io/) plugins. The `./gradlew` 
wrapper script will bootstrap the right Gradle version if it's not already 
installed. 

You'll also be able to import it into an IDE as a project via Gradle.

The client itself uses Java 1.8 or later and has a dependency on the SLF4J API.
